# Wallet
A wallet in cryptocurrency is a digital wallet that allows you to send and receive crypto assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. The wallet gives everyone access to the blockchain anywhere in the world.

You can access and transact your coins with public and private keys. However, crypto wallets have integrated various technologies, such as code scanning, resulting in simplification, automation and better UX.

Coin wallets, unlike traditional wallets, do not technically store your cryptocurrency. Your assets are stored on the blockchain ledger but can only be accessed with a private key. Your keys validate your ownership of your digital currency and allow you to conduct transactions. You lose access to your money if you lose your private keys. So, it is critical to keep your wallet secure one way or another.
