# Verse Verifier

## About
Verifier of Verse-Layer for the Oasys Blockchain.

- Verify the rolluped state by Verse-Layer to the Hub-Layer, create signature and share with other verifiers via P2P.

- The verifier is also the Hub-Layer validator and can finalize rollups by collecting signatures for 51% or more of total stake amount and submitting it to the verification contract.

- Verification of rollup state, P2P node, and submission of signatures to verification contracts can be used individually.

- All Hub Layer Validator need to install Verse Verifier. 

## Quick Start

Download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/oasysgames/verse-verifier/releases).

> The Verifier create keccak256 hash of [ethereum signed messages](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) with the same private key as the Hub-Layer validator, so it is recommended to run on the same node as the Hub-Layer validator.

Create a data directory.

```shell
mkdir /home/geth/.oasvlfy
chown geth:geth /home/geth/.oasvlfy
```

> **Please check you have password.txt & validator operator's private key on disk.**

Create a configuration file. [Click here for a sample.](./readme/config.yml)

> Open the TCP port that P2P listens on the firewall.

```shell
curl -O /home/geth/.oasvlfy/config.yml \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oasysgames/verse-verifier/main/readme/config.yml

# and edit
```

Create a systemd unit file. [Click here for a sample.](./readme/oasvlfy.service)

```shell
curl -O /usr/lib/systemd/system/oasvlfy.service \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oasysgames/verse-verifier/main/readme/oasvlfy.service

systemctl daemon-reload
```

Run the Verifier.

```shell
systemctl start oasvlfy
```

Unlock the private key if it is password protected.(Same with unlocking while setting up on hub-layer node setup.)

```shell
oasvlfy wallet:unlock --config /home/geth/.oasvlfy/config.yml --name signer
Password:
```
