# Staking(Delegating)

## Intro

There is three ways to stake.

1. [Staking using CLI](/docs/techdocs/validator/hub-layer-client-join/1-1-hub-layer-client-join)

On staking using CLI, you need to export private key while staking.

2. Staking with Oasys Hub. 

You can use web for a staking.

3. Direct contract call 

We currently do not support the official way, but we will provide web for a claim if you are an owner on a validator.
