# vNFT & oNFT / Bridge

## Highly Flexible Token Design
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) is essential asset for tokenomics in the ecosystem. Oasys' unique layer structure allows three types of token designs for NFT.

### 1. vNFT, Restrictive-Use Tokens
vNFT can be minted on the Verse Layer. The token can only be used with certain Verse-Layers. This type of FTs (e.g. in-game currency) and NFTs (e.g. IP) can not be cross-chain bridged.

### 2. oNFT, Highly Interoperable Tokens
oNFT can be minted on the Hub-Layer. The token is interoperable and is available on all Verse-Layers. Also, it can be sent to another network, such as Ethereum, by a cross-chain bridge.

### 3. exNFT, Minted in External Network Tokens
exNFT is a token minted on a network outside of Oasys. They are available on Oasys' Hub-Layer and Verse-Layer via cross-chain bridges.

## Cross-Chain Bridge for NFT
NFT bridges are available: vNFT and exNFT for NFT.

### Oasys NFT Bridge
For NFT transfers between Verses, Oasys provides an official bridge. The genuine bridge uses the Lock & Mint method. Tokens are locked on the chain before the bridge and minted on the chain after the bridge.

### High-security Cross-chain Bridges
Many cross-chain bridges are vulnerable to being targeted by hackers because they hold large amounts of money in reserve as liquidity. Once exploited, the problem can spread throughout the entire ecosystem, posing a significant risk.

Oasys enables secure bridging between Hub-Layer and Verse-Layer and between Verse-Layers without the intervention of a centralized third-party bridge operator.
