# Verse-Layer, with Incredibly High UX

![Verse Architecture](/img/docs/techdocs/verse/versearchitecture.png)

## Outline
The Verse-Layer is Oasys' Layer 2 Blockchain. While we believe several optimal Layer 2 solutions meet Oasys' requirements, the implementation we currently support is Optimism. The node implementation Optimism is forked, and the minimum necessary modifications are used. In most cases, the Verse-Layer is expected to be operated as a Permissioned Chain.

## Fraud Proof on Permissioned Chain
It takes 7 days for decentralized fraud proof for Optimistic rollup. However, we believe that the fraud-proof period can be minimized because any fraud on a permissioned chain can become a reputational risk for the entity that operates the verse. Occurred events can be verifiable as the transaction data on layer 2 is reflected on layer 1 for data availability.

## Verse Builder
Anyone can build a verse if the deposit is more than 1 million OAS on the verse contract. On the Verse-Layer, a Verse Builder takes care of node operations, and it is necessary to operate the server properly. Also, you can configure what verse builder can deploy smart contracts and what transactions can be executed without any gas.

## Free Gas For Users
On Oasys verse, users don't have to pay gas fees, which are paid by verse operators. By taking transaction fees from verse builders, it can maintain sustainability.
