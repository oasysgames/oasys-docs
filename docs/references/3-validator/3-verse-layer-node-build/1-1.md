# Verse-Layer Node Build (Optimism)

## Validator Build Steps

![verse build](/img/docs/techdocs/verse/versebuild.png)

For more detailed information about [Verse Architecture](/docs/techdocs/technologies/verse-layer/1-1),you can see before deploying verse. 

## 1. Requirements

Docker Engine v20.10.0 or later and docker-compose v2.0 or later are required.
Please Check [Hardware_Requirements](/docs/techdocs/validator/hardware-requirements/1-1) Prior to setup. 

## 2. Clone verse-layer-optimism repository
Clone the [verse-layer-optimism](https://github.com/oasysgames/verse-layer-optimism) repository provided by the Oasys Foundation.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/oasysgames/verse-layer-optimism.git /path/to/verse-layer-optimism

cd /path/to/verse-layer-optimism
```

## 3. Create Wallets

Create Ethereum wallets (address and private key) to be used by Builder, Sequencer, and Proposer.

```shell
docker-compose run --rm wallet
```

The created wallets will be saved to `./data/wallet/keys.txt`.

Notes:  
**1. These wallets requires some tokens to run Verse-Layer. For testnet, you can get a token from [Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.oasys.games/).**  
**2. Be sure to back up this file!**

```text:./data/wallet/keys.txt
- You can share your public address with anyone. Others need it to interact with you.
- You must NEVER share the secret key with anyone! The key controls access to your funds!
- You must BACKUP your key file! Without the key, it's impossible to access account funds!

---- builder ----

key:     0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef

---- sequencer ----

key:     0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
```

## 4. Deploy contracts for Verse-Layer to Hub-Layer.

Clone the [oasys-optimism](https://github.com/oasysgames/oasys-optimism) repository provided by the Oasys Foundation.


```shell
git clone https://github.com/oasysgames/oasys-optimism.git /path/to/oasys-optimism

cd /path/to/oasys-optimism/packages/contracts/

git checkout v0.1.2
```

Install dependencies and Build contracts.

```shell
npm install  # or "yarn install"

npx hardhat run scripts/generate-artifacts.ts
```

Export the network to be deployed.

```shell
export CONTRACTS_TARGET_NETWORK=oasys
```

Export the created wallet addresses.

```shell
export BUILDER_ADDRESS=0x...
export SEQUENCER_ADDRESS=0x...
export PROPOSER_ADDRESS=0x...
```

You can navigate [validator wallet](/docs/techdocs/wallet/1-2) on Verse. 

Export private key of the `builder` wallet.

```shell
export CONTRACTS_DEPLOYER_KEY=0x...
```

Export your Verse-Layer chain ID. Can't change it later, please decide carefully.

```shell
export CHAIN_ID=
```

Export the RPC URL and amount of token to deposit.

For mainnet :
```shell
export CONTRACTS_RPC_URL=https://rpc.mainnet.oasys.games/
export DEPOSIT_AMOUNT=1000000000000000000000000
```

For testnet :

```shell
export CONTRACTS_RPC_URL=https://rpc.testnet.oasys.games/
export DEPOSIT_AMOUNT=1000000000
```

Deposit OAS token.

```shell
npx hardhat verse:deposit \
  --network $CONTRACTS_TARGET_NETWORK \
  --builder $BUILDER_ADDRESS \
  --amount $DEPOSIT_AMOUNT
```

Then, Output would be like this : 

```
depositing (tx: 0x2faa04c92222133e83eb350f03ec698a4b0d2cfe0a549a118401cdc8c1f5efb8)...: success with 70490 gas
```

Deploy contracts.

```shell
npx hardhat verse:build \
  --network $CONTRACTS_TARGET_NETWORK \
  --chain-id $CHAIN_ID \
  --sequencer $SEQUENCER_ADDRESS \
  --proposer $PROPOSER_ADDRESS \
  --block-signer $SEQUENCER_ADDRESS \
  --fee-wallet $BUILDER_ADDRESS \
  --gpo-owner $BUILDER_ADDRESS
```

Then, Output would be like this : 

```
building (tx: 0xc4800ef3dc40a79a10378bf109d192c90b66b6e64a1987ddc6cdbf628d0d7d59)...: success with 17673168 gas
Success writing contract addresses to ./oasys/addresses.json
Success writing genesis block configuration to ./oasys/genesis.json
```

Copy the generated configuration filess to `assets` directory of the `verse-layer` repository.

```shell
cp ./oasys/addresses.json /path/to/verse-layer/assets/

cp ./oasys/genesis.json /path/to/verse-layer/assets/ 
```

When you have completed this step, return to the `verse-layer` repository.

```shell
cd /path/to/verse-layer
```

## 5. Create .env file

Create an environment variable configuration file for containers.

Sample for mainnet : 

```shell
cp .env.sample.mainnet .env
```

Sample for testnet :
```shell
cp .env.sample.testnet .env
```

The following settings should be changed.

```shell
# Your Verse-Layer chain ID
L2_CHAIN_ID=

# Created wallet address and key
SEQUENCER_ADDRESS=
SEQUENCER_KEY=
PROPOSER_ADDRESS=
PROPOSER_KEY=
```

## 6. Run Containers

```shell
docker-compose up -d data-transport-layer
docker-compose up -d l2geth
docker-compose up -d batch-submitter
docker-compose up -d message-relayer
```
## Permissioned chain

For running verse builder, by considering follwing parameter on permissioned chain may help: 

By deploying permission-less makes scam or non-approved contract, which makes user unsafe. 
By approving transaction freely on verse, you may attacked by unexpected gas attack, which can be controled by limiting proxy.
