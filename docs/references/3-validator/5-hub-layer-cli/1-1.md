5. An error occurs if the private key of the validator is not set.

```shell
# For mainnet
$ oaspos validator:activate --network mainnet [Validator Flag]

# For testnet
$ oaspos validator:activate --network testnet [Validator Flag]

# For custom
$ oaspos validator:activate --rpc https://example.com/ --chain-id 12345 [Validator Flag]
```

### Validator Deactivate Command
---
Use `$ oaspos validator:deactivate` command to change the validator status to disable.

Errors can occurs in the following situations:
1. An error occurs if you run `deactivate` when you are not a validator.
2. An error occurs if the status of the validator is already inactivated.
3. An error occurs if you use a custom network, when rpc, chainid is not set.
4. An error occurs if the network on which the command is to excute is not set up.

```shell
# For mainnet
$ oaspos validator:deactivate --network mainnet [Validator Flag]

# For testnet
$ oaspos validator:deactivate --network testnet [Validator Flag]

# For custom
$ oaspos validator:deactivate --rpc https://example.com/ --chain-id 12345 [Validator Flag]
```
