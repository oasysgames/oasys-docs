# What is Proof of Stake (PoS)?

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a proof system in which the greater the number of shares of the cryptocurrency owned, the greater the number of rights to record in the block are provided in proportion. To put it another way, Proof of Work (PoW) permits computational power to engage in mining, whereas Proof of Stake requires crypto owners to offer their coins as collateral to validate blocks. Because Proof of Stake can only be validated by those who own the cryptocurrency, mining competition may become obsolete, potentially bringing the nature of decentralization closer to reality.

The PoS blockchain network uses randomly-chosen validators. Following the validation of one block, the next block validator is chosen randomly as a block write. To write on the block as a validator, a crypto owner must "stake" a certain number of coins. Moreover, because the validator reviews transactions, confirm activity, votes on outcomes, and keeps records, it is more energy-efficient and scalable than the PoW mining technique. The PoS mechanism is designed to find solutions to PoW problems that result in competition for monetary value, and it naturally encourages people to seek ways to gain an advantage. However, PoW also necessitates a large amount of energy, which impacts market pricing and profitability.
