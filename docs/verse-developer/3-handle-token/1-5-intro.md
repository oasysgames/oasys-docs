# FT / NFT Design

## Highly Flexible Token Design
Fungible Tokens (FT) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) are essential assets for tokenomics in the ecosystem. Oasys' unique layer structure allows three types of token designs for FT and NFT.

### 1. vFT/vNFT, Restrictive-Use Tokens
vFT/vNFT can be minted on the Verse-Layer. The token can only be used with certain Verse-Layers. This type of FTs (e.g. in-game currency) and NFTs (e.g. IP) can not be cross-chain bridged.
### 2. oFT/oNFT, Highly Interoperable Tokens
oFT/oNFT can be minted on the Hub-Layer. The token is interoperable and is available on all Verse-Layers. Also, it can be sent to another network such as Ethereum by a cross-chain bridge.
### 3. exFT/exNFT, Minted in External Network Tokens
exFT/exNFT is a token minted on a network outside of Oasys. They are available on Oasys' Hub-Layer and Verse-Layer via cross-chain bridges.
