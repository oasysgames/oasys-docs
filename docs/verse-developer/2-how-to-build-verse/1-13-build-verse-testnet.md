# Manual for Building Verse(testnet)
You can construct Verse on the Oasys L1 Testnet.

The motivations for building Verse on the Oasys L1 Testnet are as follows:

- To test the Contract before deploying it to the Verse Mainnet
- To trial operations with Verse (Testnet) before managing the Verse (Mainnet)
- To evaluate the use of instant verification in the Verse (Mainnet)

## Build verse on L1 testnet
Please follow [Manual for Building Verse](/docs/verse-developer/how-to-build-verse/1-2-manual) to build Verse on the Oasys L1 Testnet.

## Utilizing Instant Verification
Please provide verse(testnet)information to Oasys by following form.

[To use instant verifier in verse(Testnet)](https://forms.gle/T7Bb2p1rbQ17YSEq7)

Once Oasys receives the Verse (Testnet) information, they will set up instant verification via the L1 Oasys Testnet Validator.

## Submit instant verification result
You need to build a Verse Submitter to submit the instant verification result to the `StateCommitmentChain`.
Please follow [Verse Submitter](/docs/verse-developer/how-to-build-verse/1-8-build-verse-submitter) to build verse submitter.
