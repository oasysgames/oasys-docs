# Monitoring
Since the security of Verse relies on L1, simply monitoring whether the block height is incrementing correctly, similar to a [validator node monitoring](/docs/hub-validator/operate-validator/monitor), is insufficient. Verse operates with 6 independent services, highlighting the complexity of monitoring. **To ensure that your Verse is functioning properly, we provide a shell script**. Please refer to the section below for more details.

### Monitoring Alert Assistance
We offer a helpful script designed to ensure your Verse is operating smoothly. Should any issues arise, notifications will be sent via Slack or Discord. Please refer to [L2 Monitoring Alert](https://github.com/oasysgames/oasys-optimism/wiki/L2-Monitoring-Alert).

### Troubleshooting Assistance
We offer a helpful script designed to assist in resolving any issues that may arise with your verse. Please refer to [L2 Troubleshooting](https://github.com/oasysgames/oasys-optimism/wiki/L2-Troubleshooting).
