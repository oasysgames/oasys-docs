# SAND Verse
Oasys SAND Verse network is a layer-2(Verse) used to test deploying contracts and executing transactions for verse developers.

Oasys Verse including Oasys SAND Verse doesn't need a transaction gas fee. That's why everyone can execute transactions deployed on SAND Verse.

But because everyone can see transactions with the SAND Verse explorer, We recommend not setting your project information in transactions.

## How to add SAND Verse to your metamask
Please refer to [RPC Endpoints](/docs/staking/rpc-endpoint/1-1-rpc-endpoint#sand-verse-verse-layer) to set up Oasys SAND Verse in your metamask.

## How to Obtain OAS on Sand Verse
Please visit the [faucet](https://faucet.sandverse.oasys.games/) website to get OAS tokens for making transactions.
