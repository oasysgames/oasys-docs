# Oasys Optimistic Rollup


## Multiple Optimistic Rollup

Oasys is always looking for and validating new technologies.
First we need to introduce, Why Oasys using Optimistic Roll-up : 
In Ethereum's Layer 1 structure, there were many scalability problems. For example, for many users, even if they wanted to give fast transactions, there was a limit for users and builders due to the limitation of transaction speed. 
This issue was highly adopted while designing Oasys. As a result, the roll-up was determined to be the most reliable of the scaling solutions at this point. 

In the case of the existing Layer 2, one Layer 2 accepts many Ecker systems. This creates a new Layer 2 name, but the resulting project teams are attributed to Ethereum. 
Introducing it as a scaling solution, but it is greatly affected by Ethereum. 

Of course, Ethereum is not a specialized part of the game because it is a chain made for many purposes. 

To address this and ensure the verses' independence, Oasys has come to form a Multiple Optimistic Rollup. 
The architecture of multiple Optimistic Rollups is different from the common idea that many transactions occur at Layer 1, and in fact, games require fast transactions and features like Verse, so they provide stability in the Hub, which makes Oasys unique. 

## Overcoming EVM 

Of course, EVMs have limitations in their design. 

The compatibility with Ethereum is an opportunity to use many tools and libraries in development, but in the case of EVM, the VM model is defined in a single core, which creates a performance issue. 
Due to the model of EVM, always have scaling issue, TPS makes limitations when playing a game, making it disadvantageous for game designers. 

In the case of Oasys, you can go beyond the limitations of TPS by organically connecting various Verses through Multiple Optimistic Rollup. 
It's possible to put together several machines to achieve the desired level of performance, just as we often call it elastic. 
This organic connection is possible by opening a WebSocket between Verses, which becomes a scaling solution for high-speed transactions.
