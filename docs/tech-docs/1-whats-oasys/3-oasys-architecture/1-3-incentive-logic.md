# Incentive Logic

## Staker Reward

Staker Rewards are a must for any POS architecture. Therefore, for the stability of the network, we have assigned Staker Rewards through Tokenomics. POS validates the network through the Proof of Staking. Staker Reward are calculated every epoch.

## Validator Reward

Validators will mediate transactions and stabilize the network.
The delegator can delegate tokens to the Validator, the Validator can receive a delegated token, and the Validator can receive a validator reward from the delegator. 

## Miner Incentives 

The group of people creating blocks are called Miners. Miners receive the gas fee used in the block. Under the EIP1559 standard, a small amount of the gas fee will burn, and the gas fee used in the block will be paid to the Validators Owner.
