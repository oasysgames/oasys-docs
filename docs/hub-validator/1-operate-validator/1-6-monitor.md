# Monitoring
For users who wish to monitor or check the functionality of their validator node, we will provide [helpful tips](/docs/hub-validator/operate-validator/1-6-monitor#monitoring-tips). If you require a more robust user interface(WebUI) or wish to monitor not only the status but also the performance of your validator node, we will introduce a [dedicated way](/docs/hub-validator/operate-validator/1-6-monitor#monitoring-metrics-with-rich-web-ui) for that purpose.

Just like with any other server, it's beneficial to monitor error logs on the validator node. Please be aware that `ERROR[07-26|05:32:01.016] Snapshot extension registration failed` is often output, but this is not a cause for concern. Exclude this log from your alert emission targets.

## Monitoring Tips
We believe the most straightforward and reliable way to determine whether a Validator Node is operating properly is by monitoring if the node correctly accumulates blocks at 15-second intervals.

The process of accepting/creating blocks is the end result of complex tasks performed by the validator node. If the blocks are being created regularly, it indicates that all other complex tasks are functioning properly as well.

Firstly, we will demonstrate [how to check the block height](/docs/hub-validator/operate-validator/1-6-monitor#how-to-check-block-height). Along with this, we will cover other topics that appear to be useful for monitoring. The use case highly depends on your specific situation.


### How to Check Block Height
Blocks are generated at 15-second intervals. If no block is created for over a minute, it might be worth raising an alert.
```sh
# via Command Line Interface (CLI)
$ geth attach ipc:/home/geth/.ethereum/geth.ipc --exec 'eth.blockNumber'

# via RPC
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8545/ \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"eth_blockNumber", "params":[], "id":1}'
```
### How to check if the Validator Node is catching up with the latest block
```sh
# via Command Line Interface (CLI)
$ geth attach ipc:/home/geth/.ethereum/geth.ipc -exec 'eth.syncing'
# You should expect `false` as the output.

# via RPC
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8545/ \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"eth_syncing", "params":[], "id":1}'
# If you are properly synchronized, you should see an output similar to the following:
{
    currentBlock: 4504031,
    highestBlock: 4660759,
    knownStates: 31357681,
    pulledStates: 31357680,
    startingBlock: 4504031
}
```

### How to Check if the Validator Node is Running in Mining Mode
```sh
# via Command Line Interface (CLI)
$  geth attach ipc:/home/geth/.ethereum/geth.ipc -exec 'eth.mining'
# You should expect `true` as the output.

# via RPC
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8545/ \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"eth_mining", "params":[], "id":1}'
```

### How Many Peers Are You Connected To?
```sh
# via Command Line Interface (CLI)
$ geth attach ipc:/home/geth/.ethereum/geth.ipc -exec 'admin.peers.length'
```

### How to Check Slashing Status?
Slashing occurs when your node is down. As long as your node operates normally, which can be checked via block height monitoring, slashing should not be a concern.

Please refer to [FAQ No.8](/docs/hub-validator/operate-validator/1-8-faq#q8-how-can-i-check-slashings) for further details.


## Monitoring Metrics With Rich Web UI
Validator nodes can output metrics to monitor their status and performance. The output metrics are raw data, so we're providing a method to visualize them with a rich UI using InfluxDB and Grafana. Primarily, please follow the two links below for setup instructions.

We'll demonstrate how to view these metrics using a rich web UI with [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). Please refer to the links below for basic instructions:
- [Geth Docs: Monitoring Geth with InfluxDB and Grafana](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/monitoring/dashboards)
- [Ethereum Docs: MONITORING GETH WITH INFLUXDB AND GRAFANA](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/monitoring-geth-with-influxdb-and-grafana/)

Additionally, we provide an illustrative guide. We believe the following steps will make your setup process easier. However, **please note that these instructions may be outdated**.

### Setup(Docker)

#### InfluxDB
##### Run InfluxDB
Run the InfluxDB container according to [Install InfluxDB](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.6/install/?t=Docker#persist-data-outside-the-influxdb-container).

Create a new directory to store your data in and navigate into the directory.
```shell
mkdir path/to/influxdb-docker-data-volume && cd $_
```

Run InfluxDB container
```shell
docker run \
  --name influxdb \
  -d \
  -p 8086:8086 \
  --volume $PWD:/var/lib/influxdb2 \
  influxdb:2.6.1
```

And you can access InfluxDB through `localhost:8086`.

##### Create User and Database(GUI)
To store data from geth, you must create a user and database(InfluxDB calls this bucket) at InfluxDB.

If you can access localhost:8086 from a browser, you can create a user and database.

For details, refer to [InfluxDB setup](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.6/install/#set-up-influxdb-through-the-ui).

Please sign in at `http//localhost:8086` with the following setting.

|                 |                                            |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Username         | geth                                      |
| Password | `The password you want to set`                                        |
| Bucket(Database)             | geth         |
| Organization        | oasys    |

##### Create User and Database(CLI)
To store data from geth, you must create a user and database(InfluxDB calls this bucket) at InfluxDB.

If you cannot access localhost:8086 from a browser, you can create a user and database through the InfluxDB-CLI.

For details, refer to [InfluxDB setup](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.6/install/?t=Set+up+with+the+CLI#set-up-influxdb-through-the-influx-cli).

```shell
# enter to container
docker exec -it influxdb /bin/bash
```

```shell
# In container
influx setup \
  --username geth \
  --password <PASSWORD_YOU_WANT_TO_SET> \
  --bucket geth \
  --org oasys
```

##### Check Your Access Token(GUI)
You can check access token by requesting `http://localhost:8086/api/v2/authorizations`.

It is requirement to have created user and bucket in GUI according to [Create User and Database(GUI)](#create-user-and-databasegui-1)

You can check access token at authorizations.token

```json
{
	"links": {
		"self": "/api/v2/authorizations"
	},
	"authorizations": [
		{
			"id": "0ab6d312c0215000",
			"token": "-tlSotd95mli4EAEy6pT0potClJL6gE4Zfvph3lgK9koMuwcKRiKo7yLpAze9Zxxf-gfp07bWX-xMgKkb2JogA==",
...
```

##### Check Your Access Token(CLI)
You can view access token by InfluxDB-CLI.
- [View tokens using the influx CLI](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.6/security/tokens/view-tokens/#view-tokens-using-the-influx-cli)

```shell
# enter to container
docker exec -it influxdb /bin/bash
```

```shell
# In container
influx auth list
```

Save your access token to use with Grafana.

#### Geth
Please execute the following command to allow geth to store metrics in InfluxDB.

```shell
geth --metrics --metrics.influxdb --metrics.influxdb.endpoint "http://0.0.0.0:8086" --metrics.influxdb.username "geth" --metrics.influxdb.password <YOUR_PASSWORD>
```

#### Grafana
##### Run Grafana
Please run grafana container by following command.

```shell
docker run -d --name=grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
```

##### Allow accessing InfluxDB(InfluxQL)
You can access Grafana through `localhost:3000`.

You can access a visualization dashboard. The browser will prompt for login credentials (user: `admin` and password: `admin`). When prompted, the default password should be changed and saved.

To set InfluxDB as the data source, click on the `Data sources` icon and click on `InfluxDB`.

Please set The following configuration.
```yaml

### Checklist(optional)
#### Checking Geth Sync
You can check if your geth synchronizes the other geth by checking `Latest block`.

If `Latest block` increases by four in one minute, your geth is working.

#### Checking Disk
Since geth needs to store data on the disk, you need to make sure there is enough storage space.
