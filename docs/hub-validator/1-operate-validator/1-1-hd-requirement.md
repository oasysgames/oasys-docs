# Hardware Requirement


## Intro
The Blockchain itself stores data into a decentralizes storage.
Syncing and Sharing blocks is required for stable blockchain usage.
Since producing more blocks requires storage, if your node is operated for a long time you may have to increase disk storage for stable node operations at some point in the future.

## Hub-Layer Hardware Requirements

### Recommended Environment
|||

**10,000,000 OAS is required to be staked by Delegator to validate the Hub-Layer node**

## Firewall Settings
- TCP/UDP port 30303 allowed (for P2P between nodes)
- TCP port 8545 allowed (for RPC)
- TCP/UDP port 4101 allowed (for Instant Verifier)
- TCP/UDP port 30301 allowed (for Bootnodes)
