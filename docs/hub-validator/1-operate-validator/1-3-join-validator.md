# Join Validator to PoS (CLI & Web)

## Flow Checklist

Please refer to the [**Checklist for Validators**](/docs/hub-validator/operate-validator/1-2-build-validator-node#validator-node-operation) to review the entire process.

1. Join the validator to the PoS consensus using either the CLI or the Web interface.
2. Stake or delegate **10,000,000 OAS** to activate the validator node.
3. Check the validation status in the next epoch.

## Join Validator to PoS (Web)

### Participating in PoS using the Web Interface
Before participating in PoS, ensure that you have completed the steps to build a validator node as outlined in [Building a Validator Node (Geth)](/docs/hub-validator/operate-validator/1-2-build-validator-node).

You can join the validator to the PoS network through the [tools-fe](https://tools-fe.oasys.games/join-validator) web site.

### 1. Connect Your Validator Owner Wallet
Start by logging in with your Validator owner account via MetaMask.
Ensure that your network is set to Oasys Mainnet (Testnet is not supported at the moment).

**Mainnet**

|      Name       | Value                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| ChainID         | 248                                |
| Currency Symbol | OAS                                |
| RPC             | https://rpc.mainnet.oasys.games/   |


After connecting your wallet, you will see your Validator owner address.

### 2. Register the Validator Operator
Enter the Validator Operator (operator address) and click on **Register**.
You will receive a success message upon completion.
![join](/img/docs/tech/joinvalidator/join_validator.png)

### Update Operator
Enter the new Validator Operator address and click on **Update**.
You will receive a success message upon completion.
![join_update](/img/docs/tech/joinvalidator/join_validator_update.png)

### 3. Staking
Staking is not available on the tools-fe web site. You can stake your OAS tokens using the [oasys-pos-cli](/docs/hub-validator/operate-validator/1-3-join-validator#4-staking) or the [Oasys Hub](https://hub.oasys.games/).


## Join Validator to PoS (CLI)

### Participating PoS using CLI
Before participating in PoS, you have to complete building a validator at [Build Validator Node (geth)](/docs/hub-validator/operate-validator/1-2-build-validator-node)

And we recommend to [participate PoS using WEB](/docs/hub-validator/operate-validator/1-3-join-validator#join-validator-to-pos-web).

### Download CLI Tool

To run the Staking Contract, Please download the CLI tool from Github.
    
https://github.com/oasysgames/oasys-pos-cli/releases

    
### 1. Create owner account

Create a private key for the Owner account.
If you already have an account, you can skip this step. 
You can find details in [Wallet](/docs/architecture/hub-layer/validator-account).
    
```
$ oaspos crypto:create-account
```
And following output will show up. 

```
Address : 0x0123456789abcdef...
Key     : 0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef...
```

### 2. Obtain OAS
You may need gas fees to stake tokens. So Please check that you have sufficient gas. 

If not and you want your validator to join oasys testnet PoS, you can go to [faucet](https://faucet.testnet.oasys.games/) to obtain tokens.

### 3. Register as a Validator
Using CLI Tool, You must register your validator Owner address, validator Operator Address to Staking Contract.

You can use tools-fe(WEB) instead CLI.

#### 3.1. Export Validator Owner private key 

You must export validator owner(Owner account)'s Key. 
    
```bash
$ export PRIVATE_KEY=0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef...
```

#### 3.2. Joining as a validator 
```bash
$ oaspos validator:join --network testnet --operator 0x0123456789abcdef...
```

If you successfully done, following output will show up. This means you are done with joining.
```bash
sending (tx: 0x0123456789abcdef)...: success with 130999 gas
```

validator:join command registers onto staking contract.
If you successfully registered, you may see in Oasys Hub.

### 4. Staking
You must export validator owner(Owner account)'s Key. 
Validator owner has to possess more than 10000000 OAS.
    
```bash
$ export PRIVATE_KEY=0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef...
```


```bash
$ oaspos staker:stake \
  --network mainnet \
  --validator Owner Account Address \
  --oas 10000000
```

If it's sOAS, you can input sOAS in parameter.
```bash
$ oaspos staker:stake \
  --network mainnet \
  --validator Owner Account Address \
  --soas 10000000
``` 
    
### 5. Confirming Staking
You must export validator owner(Owner account)'s Key. 
    
```bash
$ export PRIVATE_KEY=0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef...
```

After your staking is done, You may check Staking Status with following command : 
    
```bash
$ oaspos validator:info --network testnet
```
And Following output will come out.

```bash
Balance               : 9 OAS
Status                : active
Operator Address      : 0x0123456789abcdef...
Commission Rate       : 10 %
Commissions           : 0 Wei
Jailed Epoch          : 0
Current Epoch Staking : 0 Wei
Next Epoch Staking    : 10,000,000 OAS
```
    
To fully done staking, you must wait for 1 Epoch to be run on blockchain, which is approx 1 day. 


:::note Note

Currently, we highly recommend a commission rate of 10% on the mainnet. We don't want validators to compete based on low commission rates. Instead, we encourage competition through game development. This is why we are not advocating for differences in commission rates.

:::

### 6. Check node operation. 
Checking Node Status:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl status geth
```

### 7. Update Operator. 
You must export validator owner(Owner account)'s Key. 
```bash
$ export PRIVATE_KEY=0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef...
```

Two ways can be done with CLI. 

```bash
$ oaspos validator:update-operator \
  --network mainnet \
  --operator 0x0123456789abcdef...
```


```bash
$ oaspos validator:update-operator \
  --rpc https://rpc.mainnet.oasys.games/ \
  --chain-id 248 \
  --operator 0x0123456789abcdef...
```
