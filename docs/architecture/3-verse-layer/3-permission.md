# Permission by Deposit

A token deposit is required for making a Verse. 
Anyone can build a Verse if they deposit 1 million OAS on the verse contract. And it's locked up by the verse building contract for 180 days. 
This token requirement effectively increases scam resilience. Anyone can deposit tokens onto the L2 Owner while building. 
On the Verse-Layer, a Verse Builder takes care of node operations, and it is necessary to operate the server properly.
