# DPoS Consensus

## PoS 

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a type of consensus for processing transactions, writing new blocks on a blockchain, and validating the database, similar to Proof of Work (PoW). While PoW needs processing power, PoS requires owners to stake their coins in order to review new blocks and add them to the blockchain. In a nutshell, PoS eliminates the need for mining equipment, resulting in increased cost-efficiency and energy savings.

Under the PoS technique, coin owners guarantee their assets in exchange for the opportunity to validate blocks through staking and become validators. The greater the number of cryptocurrency shares owned, the more rights to record in the block are provided. Thus, participants who stake more coins are more likely to be chosen to add new blocks. The selection process can also depend on other factors such as how long validators have been staking their coins.

The coins that have been staked will be locked until you unstake them for trading. During transaction processing, the PoS protocol will select a node to evaluate the blocks and reward them for their contributions if they are correct. Because Proof of Stake can only be validated by those who own the cryptocurrency, mining competition may become obsolete, potentially bringing the nature of decentralization closer to reality.

The PoS mechanism is designed to find solutions to PoW problems that result in competition for monetary value, and it naturally encourages people to seek ways to gain an advantage. PoW also necessitates a large amount of energy, which has an impact on market pricing and profitability.

## DPOS 

DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) is one of the consensus algorithms, a new version of Proof of Stake (PoS).

As the name DPoS can be seen, DPoS is a concept that has its roots in PoS but differentiates itself in that it 'delegate' decision-making rights. The 'vote' of people with tokens selects a number of validators in the order of votes. It delegates the authority to create and validate blocks on behalf of token holders. In addition, delegators can claim rewards from the delegation.

## Minimum staking Amounnt 

In Oasys, there are no staking limits for delegators to stake. Therefore, the minimum amount for staking is 1 wei.
