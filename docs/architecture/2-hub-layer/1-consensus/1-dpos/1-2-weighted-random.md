# Miner Election Logic

Oasys is using DPoS. While selecting a block creator, a block miner is elected randomly. The staked amount is weighted while electing the miner.
If an elected miner is not responding, consensus seeks a new block miner, fixed by consensus. 

## Uncle block 

Oasys doesn't have any Uncle Block, since all block producers are selected by concensus.
