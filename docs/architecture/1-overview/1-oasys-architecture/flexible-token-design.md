# Flexible Token Design

You can have a look at our [Whitepaper](/docs/whitepaper/solution/ft-nft-design) for more info about flexible token design.

Since Oasys has ex, o, v FT & NFT in the network, we'd like to explain why we decided on a multi token design. 
When architecting Oasys, we've recognized that many IP holders are afraid of exposing their IP.

If you need to move your IP around over multiple chains, you can dothat with an oNFT or exNFt. 
This flexibility can also be used for FTs. In addition, you can choose an internal currency or global currency in your settings with the Oasys Network.
