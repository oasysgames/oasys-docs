# Multi Layered Architecture

The Hub Layer is designed to handle only specific transactions. This prevents many transactions from occurring, preventing the gas fee from rising during roll-up, and does not burden the user even if the gas price rises. 
The Verse Layer will be responsible for the transactions wich are significant for games.

Oasys can solve many issues through flexibility.

- For large projects, a public chain is established for each product
- Multiple games can configure one version 
- High TPS
- Fast Finality 

High speed and High Finality can be considered low Network Resilience, but Oasys validates all transactions through Hub Layer validators.
