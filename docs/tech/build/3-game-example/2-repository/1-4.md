# Manager Classes

To make the code more readable and modular we split up different parts of the game into different manager classes which can be found in `src/classes/game`.

![Classes Directory](/img/docs/tech/sample-game/game-classes.png)

Each class handles a separate portion of the game, such as spawning and despawning obstacles in the case of **ObstacleManager.js** or everything involving the player in the case of **PlayerCharacter.js**.

An instance for each of these managers is created in the `create` function of **Runner.js**.
Since we treat all of these managers except for the **PlayerCharacter** as modules, they can simply be commented out if you don't need them and the game will still run, just with a certain manager disabled.

**Runner.js**

``` javascript
// Runs once to initialize the game
create () { 
// Set player and follow camera
this.playerCharacter = new PlayerCharacter(this, this.audioRefs, this.selectedCharSprite)
this.cameras.main.startFollow(this.playerCharacter.sprite)
this.cameras.main.setLerp(1, 0) // Only follow horizontally
this.cameras.main.originX = 0.08

// Initialize an instance for each manager class
// Each of these can be simply commented out to disable a module if it isn't needed
this.environmentManager = new EnvironmentManager(this, this.playerCharacter.sprite, this.selectedCloudSprite)
this.groundManager = new GroundManager(this, this.playerCharacter.sprite)
this.obstacleManager = new ObstacleManager(this, this.playerCharacter.sprite, this.selectedObstacleSprite)
this.userInterface = new UserInterface(this, this.restartGame, this.returnToMenu, this.audioRefs)
```

**Example with EnvironmentManager, ObstacleManager and UserInterface being commented out**

As mentioned before we don't go into too much detail about the gameplay implementation with phaser in this tutorial, but the [official tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3) is great, so if you want to update portions of these manager classes or find the code hard to understand, please have a look at that first.

In the next chapter we will look at how blockchain functionality is implemented in dino runner.
