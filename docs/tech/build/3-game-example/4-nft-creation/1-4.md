# Smart Contract Deployment

The code to deploy our smart contract is in `scripts/deploy.js`.
It will deploy the smart contract to the specified network and mint the first token to the specified recipient address.

``` javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");

// Type your own PUBLIC key in here
const recipientAddress = ''

async function main() {
  const DinoRunner = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("DinoRunner");
  const dinoRunner = await DinoRunner.deploy();

  await dinoRunner.deployed();
  console.log("Dino Runner contract deployed to:", dinoRunner.address);

  const mintTokenTx = await dinoRunner.mint(recipientAddress);
  await mintTokenTx.wait();
  console.log(`Minted token to ${recipientAddress}`)
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

Make sure to input your own Ethereum public key in `const recipientAddress` before executing the code.
You can easily copy this from MetaMask by clicking here.

**deploy.js**

``` javascript
// Type your own PUBLIC key in here
const recipientAddress = ''
```

When you execute the script with `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js` it will only deploy on the temporary hardhat local network.
In order to deploy our smart contract to a real blockchain network or test network we need to set this up in our `hardhat.config.json`.
We added **hmvtest** as one of the networks and you can add any other network you'd like here.
Notice how the **gasPrice** is set to 0, since deploying a contract on an Oasys sub-verse doesn't require us to pay gas. If you want to deploy to most other ethereum test nets you'll first need to get funds from a fountain.

``` json
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
  defaultNetwork: "hardhat",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
    },
    hmvtest: {
      url: 'https://rpc.testnet.oasys.homeverse.games/',
      chainId: 40875,
      gasPrice: 0,
    },
  },
};
```

To use these settings when deploying we'll need to add the `--network hmvtest` flag.

``` bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hmvtest
```

When running the script you can see the address your contract got deployed to in the console.
Make sure to copy and save this somewhere, since we'll need the contract address in the next chapter.
